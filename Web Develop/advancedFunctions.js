 // Side effects:-
 //if our function is writes anything to console or external 
 //variables than that is a side effect
 // var a=1;
 //  function b() {
 //  a=2;
 //  }
 // Functional purity:-
 // try to avoid side efects and always return something
 // Deterministic:-
 //No matter how many times we call this function and pass
 // certain parameters , it will always return the same value . In turn, a function 
 //that returns a random number is not deterministic, as the 
 //same input (even if it is empty, i.e. without parameters)
 // will always output a different result.
 //1. Deterministic --> always produces the same results given the same inputs
 //2.No Side Effects -->  It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a programâ€™s execution.
 // It must only depend on its input elements.
