Kubernetes is an open source technology developed by google, In order to make orchestarting containerized application
easier
Kubernetes:Container Orchastration tool
First we have to understand What a Container is and why we use them?
A container is 
->A way to package application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration
->Portable artifact easily shared and moved around
->Makes development and deployment more efficient

Where do containers live?
->Container's repo
->Private, Public repo
->Docker repo
How container's help in development ??
The process before containers we had to follow!
->Each developers needs to install the application specific version
->Installation process different on each os environments
->Many steps where something could go wrong

How containers solve problems in Developemnent?
->We dont have to install any of the services directly on our system
->Packaged with all needed configuration
->One command to install the application
->Run the same app with 2 different versions
->Makes our local environments more efficient
Before Conatiner for deployment we have to:
->Textual guide of deployment
->Configuration on thebserver needed
->External dependencies on the server OS
->Problem dependency version

How contaners help in Deployment?
->Developer and operations work together to package the application in a container
->No environmental configuration needed on server- except for docker runtime
->
